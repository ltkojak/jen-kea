# Jen Release Notes

---

## Version 2.5.1 — April 2026

### Additional DNS Providers
The DDNS hostname lookup now supports four DNS providers:

- **Technitium DNS** — existing integration unchanged
- **Pi-hole** — supports both v5 (api.php) and v6 (new REST API with session authentication)
- **AdGuard Home** — REST API with Basic Auth, queries rewrite rules for hostname lookup
- **DNS via SSH** — runs `dig` over the existing Kea SSH connection; works with Bind9, Unbound, or any DNS server accessible from the Kea host. No additional configuration required.

Provider-specific fields show and hide dynamically when you change the DNS Provider dropdown in Settings → Infrastructure → DDNS Configuration.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed hardcoded server name `theelders` in DDNS SSH timeout error message
- Fixed hardcoded username `matthew` as SSH fallback in subnet editing
- Added 10-second TTL cache to active server detection to avoid unnecessary `ha-heartbeat` calls on every page load

---

## Version 2.5.0 — April 2026

### ntfy and Discord Alert Channels
Two new alert channel types are now supported alongside the existing Telegram, Email, Slack, and Webhook channels.

**ntfy** — works with both the public ntfy.sh server and self-hosted ntfy instances. Configurable topic, access token for protected topics, and message priority (min/low/default/high/urgent).

**Discord** — standard Discord webhook integration. Messages are formatted with bold text preserved and delivered to the configured channel with "Jen DHCP" as the sender username.

Both channels support all existing alert types including the new HA failover alert.

### Kea HA Support
Jen now has full awareness of Kea High Availability deployments.

**Active node routing** — when multiple servers are configured, Jen automatically routes `config-get` and subnet editing commands to the active primary node. Active node detection uses `ha-heartbeat` to identify the server in `hot-standby`, `load-balancing`, or `partner-down` state with primary role. Falls back to the first reachable server.

**HA state monitoring** — the background alert loop now tracks HA state for all configured servers. Any state change (including failovers, recovery, and sync events) fires an `ha_failover` alert to all configured channels.

**Servers page improvements** — the Servers page now shows an ⚡ ACTIVE indicator on the current active node, a top banner displaying the configured HA mode, and improved HA state badge colors.

**HA configuration UI** — new High Availability card in Settings → Infrastructure with HA mode dropdown (standalone / hot-standby / load-balancing / passive-backup) and primary server name field. Also configurable via `jen.config` `[kea]` section with `ha_mode` and `name` keys.

### DDNS — Provider-Agnostic
The DDNS page is no longer tied to Technitium DNS.

The DNS provider is now configurable in Settings → Infrastructure → DDNS Configuration with three options:
- **Technitium** — existing Technitium REST API integration (unchanged for existing users)
- **Generic** — hostname lookup via `dig`/`host` over SSH to the Kea server
- **None** — log viewer only, no hostname lookup

Also configurable via `jen.config [ddns]` with the `dns_provider` key.

## Version 2.4.10 — April 2026

### Documentation Updates
- `docs/user-guide.md` — added Device Inventory, device fingerprinting badges, API Keys, MFA enrollment, and Settings → Icons sections (all missing since 2.x)
- `docs/faq.md` — added FAQ sections for device fingerprinting, randomized MACs (iOS private MACs), REST API, and MFA
- Version references updated throughout

---

## Version 2.4.9 — April 2026

### Docker Fixes
- Fixed Dockerfile missing pip packages required for MFA: `pyotp`, `qrcode[pil]`, `authlib`, `cryptography`
- Fixed Dockerfile not copying `static/icons/brands/` — brand SVG logos were missing in Docker deployments
- Added `jen-icons` volume to both compose files so user-uploaded custom icons survive container updates
- Bumped image tag to `jen-dhcp:2.4.9` in both compose files

---

## Version 2.4.8 — April 2026

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed device edit modal not opening for devices with names or owners — inline onclick broken by double quotes inside HTML attributes; switched to data-* attributes with event delegation
- Fixed device fingerprint badges not showing on Leases, Reservations, and Dashboard — MAC case mismatch (Kea uppercase vs devices table lowercase)
- Fixed Apple TV not getting Apple TV icon
- Fixed missing Lenovo OUI `c0:a5:e8`, Roku OUI `50:06:f5`, Amazon Echo Show OUIs
- Fixed device edit failing for icon names longer than 10 characters — column widened to VARCHAR(50)

---

## Version 2.4.x — April 2026

### Device Fingerprinting
Automatic device identification by manufacturer and type using OUI (MAC address prefix) lookup. Runs in the background every 30 seconds. OUI database covers 800+ prefixes: Apple, Samsung, Amazon, Google, Raspberry Pi, Roku, Ring, Sonos, Ecobee, Ubiquiti, Cisco, Netgear, Synology, QNAP, Meross, TP-Link/Kasa, Espressif (ESP8266/ESP32/ESPHome/Tasmota), Philips Hue, Lutron, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Intel, LG, Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, printers, virtual machines, and more.

Hostname-based fallback for randomized MACs (iOS 14+ private MAC addresses).

### Brand SVG Logos
24 bundled Simple Icons SVG logos display in Device Inventory, Leases, Reservations, and Dashboard. Manufacturer badges appear next to hostnames on every page.

### Manual Device Type Override
Edit any device to manually set its type. Manual overrides show a lock indicator. The background tracking loop respects overrides and will not overwrite them.

### Visual Icon Picker
Device edit modal includes a visual grid of brand logo previews for icon selection.

### Custom Icon Management
Settings → Icons: upload custom SVGs to override bundled icons or add new manufacturers. Stored in `/opt/jen/static/icons/custom/` and survive upgrades.

### Device Type & Subnet Filters
Type filter bar and subnet filter dropdown added to the Device Inventory page.

### API Enrichment
`GET /api/v1/leases` now returns `manufacturer` and `device_type` per lease.

---

## Version 2.3.x — April 2026

### REST API
Read-only REST API at `/api/v1/` for integration with Home Assistant, Zabbix, and custom scripts.

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/health` | Kea status and Jen version — no auth required |
| `GET /api/v1/subnets` | Subnet utilization with pool sizes and percentages |
| `GET /api/v1/leases` | Active leases, filterable by subnet/MAC/hostname |
| `GET /api/v1/leases/{mac}` | Single device lease with `active` boolean |
| `GET /api/v1/devices` | Device inventory, filterable by MAC/name/subnet |
| `GET /api/v1/devices/{mac}` | Single device with `online` status and current lease |
| `GET /api/v1/reservations` | Reservations, filterable by subnet |

Authentication: `Authorization: Bearer jen_your_key_here`

### API Key Management
Settings → API Keys: generate named read-only keys, revoke or delete. Key shown once at creation.

### Live API Documentation
Settings → API Docs: all endpoints documented with parameters, examples, and ready-to-paste Home Assistant YAML and Zabbix HTTP agent config.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed column sorting only applying to current page — now server-side ORDER BY before pagination
- Fixed CSV Import, lease release, MFA device revoke, MFA policy save — routes were missing
- Fixed Add Reservation form subnet pre-selection from Leases pin button
- Standardized table row height and font size across all pages

---

## Version 2.2.x — April 2026

### Stability & Bug Fixes

- Fixed subnets page showing empty lease duration and no address pools
- Fixed DDNS log reading via SSH from Kea server
- Fixed Server Status dashboard widget showing real data
- Server-side sorting on Leases, Reservations, and Devices
- Replaced dropdown nav with flat links and contextual section tab bars
